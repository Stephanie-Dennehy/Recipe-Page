## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a few new things in this project. I had never created a list where I needed the bullet points/numbers to be a different color. So I enjoyed learning about using the li::marker in CSS. 

I also went back and forth between trying to create a table or using flex box for the nutrition info displayed at the bottom of the page. I ultimately settled on flex box because it seemed like a simpler solution that was easier to read than trying to invert the row and columns of the table. 


### Continued development

I feel like I still need more practice with media queries and making my pages responsive on all devices.
